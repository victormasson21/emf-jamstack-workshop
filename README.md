👨🏻‍💻EMF Students. This project is for you to experiment with for this workshop.

Instructions:
1. Fork the repo (top right)
2. Clone your copy `git clone <your repo url>`
3. Run `git remote -v` if no remote exists, add a local remote to your repo so you can push updates to your github copy `git remote set-url <your repo url>` then `git push`

5. Run `npm i` in the project root.
